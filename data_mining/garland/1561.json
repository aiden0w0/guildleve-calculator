{"leve":{"name":"A Cherry-red Herring","description":"I want to add something to my menu to really whet the appetite of my customers. A dish people aren't like to see in Lakeland. Cherry herring might see the job done, but it's a long way to Il Mheg. I suspect the fisher who accepts this request would prefer not to return to Il Mheg any time soon, so be sure to bring back as many as you can carry.","id":1561,"patch":5.0,"client":"Facet of Nourishing Master Culinarian, Saulfort","lvl":74,"jobCategory":19,"levemete":1027849,"areaid":2951,"xp":5078571,"gil":1100,"rewards":734,"plate":80068,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110114,"repeats":2,"requires":[{"item":27473,"amount":3}],"complexity":{"nq":72,"hq":87}},"rewards":{"id":734,"entries":[{"item":27583,"rate":0.5,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.5}]},"ingredients":[{"name":"Cherry Herring","id":27473,"icon":29580,"category":47,"ilvl":400,"price":600,"ventures":[843],"fishingSpots":[223]}],"partials":[{"type":"fishing","id":"223","obj":{"i":223,"n":"The Spoiled One","l":74,"c":1,"z":2956,"x":28.93,"y":13.51}},{"type":"item","id":"27585","obj":{"i":27585,"n":"Marble Nymph","l":360,"c":27038,"t":33,"p":66}},{"type":"leve","id":"1561","obj":{"i":1561,"n":"A Cherry-red Herring","l":74,"j":19,"p":2951}},{"type":"npc","id":"1027849","obj":{"i":1027849,"n":"Shue-Hann","l":2951}},{"type":"item","id":"27583","obj":{"i":27583,"n":"Moyebi Shrimp","l":330,"c":27037,"t":33,"p":112}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}},{"type":"item","id":"27473","obj":{"i":27473,"n":"Cherry Herring","l":400,"c":29580,"t":47}}]}
