{"leve":{"name":"West Bank Story","description":"The flames of the Calamity claimed large swaths of the primeval forest surrounding Gridania. Recognizing the importance of helping the Twelveswood and her kindred spirits recover, the Seedseers launched a large-scale reforestation effort, which began even before the rebuilding of the cityâ€“state. To ensure that the trees planted during that effort are growing properly and without disease, the Greatloam Growery conducts periodic studies of the young foliage, and seeks eager botanists to travel to the west bank of the Central Shroud river known as the West Vein and collect samples.","id":683,"patch":2.0,"client":"Botanists' Guild Receptionist, Leonceault Leadthumb","lvl":10,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000105,"coords":[21.67,20.81],"zoneid":54,"areaid":94,"rewards":215,"plate":80029,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110014},"rewards":{"id":215,"entries":[{"item":4,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":3,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":2,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":5,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":7,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":6,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":4,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":3,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":2,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":5,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":7,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":6,"rate":0.04,"amount":32}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000105","obj":{"i":1000105,"n":"Tierney","l":54,"q":2,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
