{"leve":{"name":"Breathe Deeply","description":"Families of those who perish from the Red Throat are cautious of attending their loved ones' last services due to the spread of the disease. Therefore, we friars have taken to placing charms made from saint's breath upon the mouth of the deceased, allowing the Fury's protection to the living within the sanctity of the church. The popularity of such charms has depleted what remnants we had, and we request a botanist to provide us with more tufts.","id":1149,"patch":3.0,"client":"Order of the Friars Templar, Brother Padilloux","lvl":50,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[30.36,32.86],"zoneid":2200,"areaid":2204,"gil":834,"rewards":468,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110090},"rewards":{"id":468,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":15}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
