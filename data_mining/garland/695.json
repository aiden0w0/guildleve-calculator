{"leve":{"name":"Moon in Rouge","description":"We Keepers of the Moon have a long history of decorating our faces with colorful paint before going into battle. We do this not only to honor the traditions of our clan, but to also let the gods know that we are prepared to serve them as warriors in the afterlife, should we fall at the hands of our enemies. The paint we use is taken from the inedible red berries of a herb known as 'soldier's sore' that can be found growing in the South Shroud. My unit is willing to pay handsomely for any who can harvest the fruit and deliver it to our barracks.","id":695,"patch":2.0,"client":"Second Spear Wood Wailer, Pimoh Nelhah","lvl":25,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000823,"coords":[24.4,18.52],"zoneid":56,"areaid":129,"rewards":218,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110017},"rewards":{"id":218,"entries":[{"item":21072,"rate":0.4},{"item":6141,"rate":0.2},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":44}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000823","obj":{"i":1000823,"n":"Nyell","l":56,"q":1,"t":"Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"6141","obj":{"i":6141,"n":"Cordial","l":25,"c":20622,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
