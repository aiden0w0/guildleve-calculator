{"leve":{"name":"No Bark, All Bite","description":"Several varieties of funguar are known to release their spores directly onto the bark of wounded trees, so that the spores may take hold quicker. Unfortunately, this often results in the wound spreading, eventually leading to the death of the host plant. The Greatloam Growery seeks skilled botanists to travel into the forest and seek out trees that show blotchy patches of white─a telltale sign that they have been infected with the funguar spores─and use their hatchets to carefully remove the affected area.","id":681,"patch":2.0,"client":"Botanists' Guild, Master Gabineaux","lvl":5,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1001866,"coords":[28.05,21.77],"zoneid":54,"areaid":90,"rewards":214,"plate":80030,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110013},"rewards":{"id":214,"entries":[{"item":4,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":3,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":2,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":5,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":7,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":6,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":4,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":3,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":2,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":5,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":7,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":6,"rate":0.04,"amount":28}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1001866","obj":{"i":1001866,"n":"Muriaule","l":54,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
