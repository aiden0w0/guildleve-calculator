{"leve":{"name":"Stay for a Vile","description":"As their name implies, vilekin are foul creatures who spread filth and disease. Not only are their constant buzzings a nuisance, but their bites can invoke all manner of blights and sicknesses. To protect the local fauna from these pests, the Trappers' League, with approval from Stillglade Fane, has not only issued an edict allowing the hunting of certain vilekin, but will pay good gil when presented with proof of extermination.","id":504,"patch":2.0,"client":"Trappers' League Huntsman, Eugenaire the Grey","lvl":1,"jobCategory":34,"levemete":1001866,"coords":[27.38,15.91],"zoneid":54,"areaid":90,"plate":80026,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110008},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1001866","obj":{"i":1001866,"n":"Muriaule","l":54,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
