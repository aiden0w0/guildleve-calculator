{"leve":{"name":"Always Right","description":"If I was as rich as some of my patrons, I'd be drinking naught but the finest ales and wines that money could buy. But these Ul'dahns, all they want to do all day is sip on coconut piss. Say it's good for calming the humours, they do. Bah, a man what needs his humours calmed is a man what's not worth living, I say. On the other hand, I run me a business, and what good's a business if it won't see to the demands of its patrons. And so, I suppose I'll keep splitting open island coconuts as long as there's someone to collect them for me.","id":701,"patch":2.0,"client":"Flying Shark Proprietor, Dyrstweitz the Daft","lvl":30,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1004344,"coords":[29.33,28.81],"zoneid":32,"areaid":206,"rewards":219,"plate":80030,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110039},"rewards":{"id":219,"entries":[{"item":21072,"rate":0.4},{"item":6141,"rate":0.2},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":48}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1004344","obj":{"i":1004344,"n":"Nahctahr","l":32,"q":1,"t":"Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"6141","obj":{"i":6141,"n":"Cordial","l":25,"c":20622,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
