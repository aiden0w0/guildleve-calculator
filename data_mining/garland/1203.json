{"leve":{"name":"Crystal Chronicles","description":"The stained crystal adorning the buildings of the Holy See is a magnificent manifestation of the devotion of Ishgard's artisans. While we do our best to preserve it, time loosens the ancient frames that hold the pieces, leaving them to rattle and chip in the wind. As we commence our grand-scale restoration, the Holy See has cast the locks from the coffers to see the finest materials prepared for the task. We ask that only miners with considerable experience extract the crystal needed.","id":1203,"patch":3.0,"client":"Order of the Friars Templar, Brother Padilloux","lvl":58,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[34.34,19.92],"zoneid":2001,"areaid":2033,"gil":916,"rewards":482,"plate":80030,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110097},"rewards":{"id":482,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":22}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
