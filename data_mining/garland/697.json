{"leve":{"name":"Mushroom Gobblin'","description":"Ever since the return of goblins to the Twelveswood, strange mushrooms have been spotted sprouting from the trunks of trees throughout the forest. The Greatloam Growery has yet to determine whether or not this new species of seedkin is harmful to its hosts, and therefore requires several samples on which it may conduct its tests. A reward has been set aside for all botanists who are able to lend their services to the procurement of these mushrooms for the guild.","id":697,"patch":2.0,"client":"Fifth Spear Wood Wailer, Castellaint the Careful","lvl":25,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000823,"coords":[27.66,21.56],"zoneid":56,"areaid":129,"rewards":218,"plate":80030,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110017},"rewards":{"id":218,"entries":[{"item":21072,"rate":0.4},{"item":6141,"rate":0.2},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":44}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000823","obj":{"i":1000823,"n":"Nyell","l":56,"q":1,"t":"Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"6141","obj":{"i":6141,"n":"Cordial","l":25,"c":20622,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
