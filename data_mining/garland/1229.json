{"leve":{"name":"Hundred Fins for a Hundred Wings (L)","description":"The hundred fins which swim about the Churning Mists could quite possibly be part of a dragon's daily diet, and according to the field anglers accompanying the exploration parties, there have been instances of dragons devouring them whole. A starving dragon would be too weak for combat, so if the reports are true, we would have you fish as many of the hundred fins as you can so that one of their food sources may be depleted.
