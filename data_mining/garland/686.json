{"leve":{"name":"The Quick and the Dead","description":"As its name implies, quickweed is a swift-growing plant that, in a matter of days, can cover an entire field if left untouched. Farmers and smallholders especially despise the plant, as it quickly drains even the richest soil of its nutrients, dooming crops for an entire season. The damage, however, is not merely limited to farmsteads. Quickweed can also drain the life of the forest's guardiansâ”€the Hedgetrees. This cannot be allowed to happen, and so the Botanists' Guild is offering good coin to all those who will assist in the eradication of this invasive plant.","id":686,"patch":2.0,"client":"Stillglade Fane Conjurer, Brother Waldew","lvl":15,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000821,"coords":[15.96,28.87],"zoneid":55,"areaid":107,"rewards":216,"plate":80029,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110015},"rewards":{"id":216,"entries":[{"item":21072,"rate":0.4},{"item":6141,"rate":0.2},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":11},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":11},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":11},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":11},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":11},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":11},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":36},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":36},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":36},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":36},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":36},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":36}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000821","obj":{"i":1000821,"n":"Qina Lyehga","l":55,"q":1,"t":"Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"6141","obj":{"i":6141,"n":"Cordial","l":25,"c":20622,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
