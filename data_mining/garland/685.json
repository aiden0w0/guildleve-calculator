{"leve":{"name":"The Heart of the Hedge","description":"Hedgetrees play an important role in the forest by helping to maintain the protective barrier which shields the Twelveswood from harm. Should the trees become damaged, the forest would find itself more susceptible to outside danger. One manner of threat to these guardians is roselet seeds, which get lodged in pockets of soil that gather on a Hedgetree's trunk or limbs. Once sprouted, the roselet saplings will send a taproot deep into the tree's core, where it will divert the flow of nutrients to its own body. In severe cases, this can result in the withering of large branches. To ensure this does not happen, the Botanists' Guild seeks volunteers to travel to nearby Hedgetrees and examine the bark for seeds, removing any they find.","id":685,"patch":2.0,"client":"Stillglade Fane Conjurer, Brother Waldew","lvl":10,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000105,"coords":[20.45,30.63],"zoneid":54,"areaid":94,"rewards":215,"plate":80040,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110014},"rewards":{"id":215,"entries":[{"item":4,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":3,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":2,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":5,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":7,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":6,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":4,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":3,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":2,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":5,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":7,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":6,"rate":0.04,"amount":32}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000105","obj":{"i":1000105,"n":"Tierney","l":54,"q":2,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
