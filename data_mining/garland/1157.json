{"leve":{"name":"Coat the Harm (L)","description":"A dragon claw to a soft stomach will speed a man towards his congregation with Halone unless proper steps are taken to stem the bleeding. A remedy known as Mother's Mercy can swiftly coat the inside of the stomach, allowing the blood to clot and the wound to close. But the medicine requires a substantial amount of gentian, which is difficult to come by in these parts and for which I would pay a sackful of coin to the botanist who can procure some for me.","id":1157,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Hospitalier Captain Abel Whitecape","lvl":52,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[28.54,15.18],"zoneid":2000,"areaid":2018,"gil":5092,"rewards":474,"plate":80029,"frame":80002,"areaicon":110091},"rewards":{"id":474,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":32}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
