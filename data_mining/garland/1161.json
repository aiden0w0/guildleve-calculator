{"leve":{"name":"Dandelion Don't Tell No Lies","description":"In one of the Temple Knight libraries, I came across a curious letter from one hundred summers past. A medic was traveling with a squadron of knights which was driven into the arms of the enemy and forced to fend for themselves for a fortnight. Hungry and fatigued, they consumed a withered plant for sustenance and saw their muscles bulge in a matter of moments. With their enhanced physical state, it was said they cleaved their way out, a single stroke of the strongarm beheading three or four dragons! The sketch in the letter bears a striking resemblance to the heirloom dandelion which thrives in the dragons' lair, and I suspect it is the selfsame miracle shrub. Pluck them for me so I may experiment with petal extractions.","id":1161,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Hospitalier Captain Abel Whitecape","lvl":54,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[30.1,35.79],"zoneid":2002,"areaid":2042,"gil":1032,"rewards":470,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110093},"rewards":{"id":470,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":18}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
