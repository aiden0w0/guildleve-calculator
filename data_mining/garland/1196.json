{"leve":{"name":"Fake-icite","description":"The Rose Knights have relayed a peculiar message that a bright-red ore with the consistency of rare furite has been found in plenty on various isles throughout the Sea of Clouds. The question that comes to mind is that if it looks like furite and can be smelted like furite, can it be used in place of furite? I seek a miner who can bring us copious amounts of the questionable ore that our forges may put my theory to the proof.","id":1196,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Second Commander Ser Handeloup","lvl":56,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[17.34,32.85],"zoneid":2100,"areaid":2116,"gil":828,"rewards":481,"plate":80030,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110099},"rewards":{"id":481,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":19}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
