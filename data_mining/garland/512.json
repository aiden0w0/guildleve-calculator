{"leve":{"name":"Bug Bites","description":"There are some types of vilekin which we welcome on the Red Rooster Stead, one of those being ladybugs, for they feed upon the foul aphids who suck the lifeblood from our crops. The local puks, however, consider the ladybugs a delicacy, and will descend from their rocky nests every morning to feast. The Stead is offering good coin to any adventurer who will travel to the nearby rocky outcroppings, lure out the hungry puks, and slay them. We would also appreciate it if, in your search for the puks, you come across any ladybugs infected with leafbleed, you deal with them, as well.","id":512,"patch":2.0,"client":"Red Rooster Stead Landlord, Anaoc the Youngest","lvl":1,"jobCategory":34,"levemete":1004342,"coords":[24.75,25.1],"zoneid":31,"areaid":200,"plate":80055,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110028},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1004342","obj":{"i":1004342,"n":"Wyrkholsk","l":31,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
