{"leve":{"name":"Ladies and Gentians","description":"The infirmaries that treat the Temple Knights want not for tools nor coin, yet we lament the demise of once common ingredients for medicine. The gentian plant is one we took for granted, as those bushes which were closest to the capital have long since perished in the everwinter of Coerthas. I hear some small patches may be found in the Chocobo Forest these days, and the lack of supply tends to weigh on our minds. Might you harvest some stock to replenish our cabinets?","id":1154,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Hospitalier Captain Abel Whitecape","lvl":52,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[28.54,15.18],"zoneid":2000,"areaid":2018,"gil":1062,"rewards":469,"plate":80029,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110091},"rewards":{"id":469,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":16}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
