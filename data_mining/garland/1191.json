{"leve":{"name":"Dreams of War, Dreams of Liars, Dreams of Dragon Fire","description":"There has been some increased interest among the Temple Knights concerning the Twelve's legendary weapons which struck at Nidhogg. While the stories speak of the weapons forged with sand from the slumbering eyes of Halone, that the arms existed cannot be denied, and real arms are smelt with real sand. If a miner could extract some from the outcrops in the Sea of Clouds, surely there would be knights who would pay handsomely for samples with which to create replicas in homage to the ancient heroes.","id":1191,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Minister of Coin, Amianne Tristelle","lvl":54,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[28.62,37.47],"zoneid":2002,"areaid":2042,"gil":902,"rewards":480,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110098},"rewards":{"id":480,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":18}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
