{"leve":{"name":"Digging Deep","description":"By nature, chocobos are excellent diggers and, when properly trained, can be used to unearth mushrooms, tubers, or sometimes even hidden treasure. When left unattended, however, chocobos will instinctively claw and peck away at the groundâ”€especially near partially buried items such as fence posts. When this occurs, the birds can escape their corrals, costing the owners thousands of gil in retrieval costs. One way to prevent this type of mishap is by burying fence posts deep into the soil. The only requirement here being that the posts be of a certain height so that once they are set, the chocobos won't be able to leap over them, let alone dig them up. Moogle's Gift Mounts will generously reward any adventurer with the skill to procure logs which will suit their needs.","id":684,"patch":2.0,"client":"Moogle's Gift Mounts Stablehand, Gustavain Gysahlheart","lvl":10,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000105,"coords":[20.2,20.21],"zoneid":54,"areaid":94,"rewards":215,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110014},"rewards":{"id":215,"entries":[{"item":4,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":3,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":2,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":5,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":7,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":6,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":4,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":3,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":2,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":5,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":7,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":6,"rate":0.04,"amount":32}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000105","obj":{"i":1000105,"n":"Tierney","l":54,"q":2,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
