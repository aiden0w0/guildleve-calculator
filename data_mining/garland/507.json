{"leve":{"name":"Bug Looks Like a Lady","description":"Ladybugs may be classified as vilekin, but they are anything but vile. In fact, they feed on the very vermin who infest our crops here at the Red Rooster Stead, making them more than welcome in our fields. That is, the ones who aren't carrying the terrible leafbleed blight. Rumor states several infected ladybugs hitched a ride on a merchant's vessel carrying fruit from Gridania. Now, not only are they spreading the sickness to the crops, but to healthy La Noscean ladybugs as well. The Stead is looking for adventurers to seek out the carriers of the blight and eliminate them, trying not to harm any of the unaffected ladybugs in the process.","id":507,"patch":2.0,"client":"Red Rooster Stead Landlord, Anaoc the Youngest","lvl":1,"jobCategory":34,"levemete":1004342,"coords":[23.85,23.02],"zoneid":31,"areaid":200,"plate":80021,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110028},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1004342","obj":{"i":1004342,"n":"Wyrkholsk","l":31,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
