{"leve":{"name":"Heart to Heart","description":"A hand of one of the Vault's more exalted priests pleads an urgent task, but one that must be kept to utmost confidence. His master developed a taste for deviled eggs as an afternoon snack and by sunset, he is no longer able to keep his—ahem—silence during evening prayer. The scent is so overpowering that filling the room with incense has little effect. Master Martineau advised me that the leaves from giant artichokes can calm offending winds when dried and ground into a cup of tea. I promise a great reward to anyone who can fetch the artichokes for the pantry. Do hurry, as we would prefer to save the holy incense for more spiritual purposes.","id":1166,"patch":3.0,"client":"Order of the Friars Templar, Brother Padilloux","lvl":56,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[17.07,32.5],"zoneid":2100,"areaid":2116,"gil":1608,"rewards":471,"plate":80030,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110094},"rewards":{"id":471,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":13},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":19},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":19}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
