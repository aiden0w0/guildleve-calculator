{"leve":{"name":"Hot Tub Clime Machine (L)","description":"Knights spend their lives training to become an instrument of the Fury's will, palms calloused and backs burdened by the plate. However, not every moment requires rigid formality, and something as simple as a steaming soak in a wooden bath is one of the few pleasures afforded to us in our short lives. I have commissioned a large wooden basin with which the men may rejuvenate their weary muscles, and it must be constructed from wood that can withstand the harsh clime. Lumber from caelumtrees looks to be of durable quality.","id":1159,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Second Commander Ser Handeloup","lvl":52,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[34.77,25.3],"zoneid":2000,"areaid":2018,"gil":5417,"rewards":474,"plate":80044,"frame":80002,"areaicon":110091},"rewards":{"id":474,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":22},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":32},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":32}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
