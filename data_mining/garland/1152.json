{"leve":{"name":"A Crown for Every Head (L)","description":"During a festival honoring Saint Valeroyant, it is tradition for the Temple Knights to take to the streets and adorn children's heads with flower crowns woven from tufts of saint's breath. The day draws nigh and the order must lose no time in braiding and blessing the charms. Bring us ricks of the grass posthaste, so that there may be a wreath for every child in the capital.","id":1152,"patch":3.0,"client":"Order of the Friars Templar, Brother Padilloux","lvl":50,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[30.36,32.86],"zoneid":2200,"areaid":2204,"gil":4669,"rewards":473,"plate":80044,"frame":80002,"areaicon":110090},"rewards":{"id":473,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":20},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":20},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":20},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":20},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":20},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":20},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":30},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":30},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":30},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":30},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":30},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":30}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
