{"leve":{"name":"Waking Wood","description":"In addition to the mass destruction it wrought, the Calamity was also a catalyst for dramatic change within the Twelveswood's natural order. As habitats were altered, so too were behavior patterns of the forest's creatures, the treants being no exception. Since the inception of the Seventh Umbral Era, an increasing number of once-dormant oaks and maples have suddenly risen from the soil, striking fear into the smallholders who cultivate the lands outside of Gridania. To determine the reasons behind this mass awakening, the Greatloam Growery seeks able-bodied botanists to bring back samples of the local foliage.","id":674,"patch":2.0,"client":"Botanists' Guild Receptionist, Leonceault Leadthumb","lvl":1,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1001866,"coords":[21.78,16.89],"zoneid":54,"areaid":90,"rewards":213,"plate":80029,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110012},"rewards":{"id":213,"entries":[{"item":4,"rate":0.13,"amount":7},{"item":3,"rate":0.13,"amount":7},{"item":2,"rate":0.13,"amount":7},{"item":5,"rate":0.13,"amount":7},{"item":7,"rate":0.13,"amount":7},{"item":6,"rate":0.13,"amount":7},{"item":4,"rate":0.04,"amount":24},{"item":3,"rate":0.04,"amount":24},{"item":2,"rate":0.04,"amount":24},{"item":5,"rate":0.04,"amount":24},{"item":7,"rate":0.04,"amount":24},{"item":6,"rate":0.04,"amount":24}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1001866","obj":{"i":1001866,"n":"Muriaule","l":54,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
