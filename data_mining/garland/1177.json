{"leve":{"name":"Thank You for Smoke Screening (L)","description":"The Temple Knights are looking into development of smoke candles that, when lit in proper conditions, will irritate dragon eyes and conceal the movement and numbers of our companies. Dravanians cannot make use of protective masks as our men can, so to utilize the power of smoke is to our advantage. I am certain there are plants in the wild that can be dried and lit to produce a thick enough haze, hence should you have interest in a good amount of coin, the order is looking for someone who can provide them with smoke-producing plants that might serve as viable candidates.","id":1177,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Second Commander Ser Handeloup","lvl":58,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[28.46,19.79],"zoneid":2001,"areaid":2033,"gil":4491,"rewards":477,"plate":80040,"frame":80002,"areaicon":110092},"rewards":{"id":477,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":44}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
