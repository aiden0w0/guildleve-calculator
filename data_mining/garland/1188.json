{"leve":{"name":"Forging Lance Base (L)","description":"Lancite, so named for its resemblance to a cluster of lances, is used in the creation of ceremonial spear tips. In preparation for the initiation of new recruits, the Skysteel Manufactory has requested a large order of the ore so they, in collaboration with the Order of the Friars Templar, may begin the ritualistic process of forging. Make for the Dravanian forelands and cut out great chunks, and the manufactory shall reward you fairly.
