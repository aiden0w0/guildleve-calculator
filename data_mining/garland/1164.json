{"leve":{"name":"Sacrilege Neutralized (L)","description":"A revered knight bested a particularly large dragon in battle, but in its dying throes, the foe took the knight's calf in its jagged jaws, shredding his armor into ribbons and inflicting a deep wound. Through our miraculous works and the will of Halone has he been saved, yet the mauled leg has become corrupted with evil humours, and grows more infected by the day. In preparation for an amputation, our chirurgeons require the milk in the stem of the heirloom dandelion, which proves an effective analgesic for surgical practices. Produce for us bouquets of the flower so that we may ease his pain and sever the rotting leg.","id":1164,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Hospitalier Captain Abel Whitecape","lvl":54,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[30.1,35.79],"zoneid":2002,"areaid":2042,"gil":4477,"rewards":475,"plate":80044,"frame":80002,"areaicon":110093},"rewards":{"id":475,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":24},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":24},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":24},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":24},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":24},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":24},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":36},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":36},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":36},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":36},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":36},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":36}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
