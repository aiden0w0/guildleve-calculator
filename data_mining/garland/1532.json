{"leve":{"name":"Spiritual Ventures","description":"After careful consideration, I've decided to try my hand at making spirits together with the artisans of the Crystalline Mean. Before there can be spirits, however, we must have casks. Which means we require lumber. But I want these spirits to be special. I want them to have a flavor unlike anything we've tasted at the Crystarium. If you wouldn't mind the journey, I'd like to ask you to bring us some deadwood from Amh Araeng.","id":1532,"patch":5.0,"client":"Wandering Stairs Proprietor, Glynard","lvl":76,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1027847,"coords":[16.33,21.7],"zoneid":2955,"areaid":2955,"gil":1697,"rewards":623,"plate":80065,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110118},"rewards":{"id":623,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":33},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":33},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":33},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":33},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":33},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":33},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":40},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":40},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":40},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":40},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":40},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":40}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1027847","obj":{"i":1027847,"n":"Eirikur","l":2951,"q":1,"t":"Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
