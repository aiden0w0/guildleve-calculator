{"leve":{"name":"Dragonproofing","description":"I never cease to be impressed by the buildings in Sharlayan, made of sturdy stone and vastly different from the architecture of the Pillars. Ere it was abandoned, the cityâ€“state was renowned for the fortifications which protected its scholars from the Horde's assaults. Mayhap there is knowledge yet to be found within those walls to fortify our own bulwarks. Journey to the Dravanian hinterlands and bring back samples of Sharlayan flagstone so I may better learn what kind of materials were used.","id":1204,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Second Commander Ser Handeloup","lvl":58,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[31.43,21.03],"zoneid":2001,"areaid":2033,"gil":916,"rewards":482,"plate":80040,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110097},"rewards":{"id":482,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":22}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
