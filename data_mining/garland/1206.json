{"leve":{"name":"Not So Crystal Clear (L)","description":"The Holy See has ordered a grand restoration of the stained crystal windows of the church, but the last miner I commissioned brought in crystal of dismal quality! You see, the transparency of the crystal must shine with adequate brightnessâ€”too bright and it distracts from prayer, too dark and one cannot see the service. Bring me the right stained crystal and I shall pay you double.","id":1206,"patch":3.0,"client":"Order of the Friars Templar, Brother Padilloux","lvl":58,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[34.34,19.92],"zoneid":2001,"areaid":2033,"gil":3516,"rewards":487,"plate":80030,"frame":80002,"areaicon":110097},"rewards":{"id":487,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":44}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
