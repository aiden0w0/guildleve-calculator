{"leve":{"name":"Sharlayan Sympathizers (L)","description":"While the inhabitants of Sharlayan disapproved of our war with the Dravanians, the style of their architecture speaks of more than neutrality. Rumors have spread among the denizens of the camp about secret sympathies towards the dragons, which were written in code on the walls of their buildings. I find these insinuations to be absolute rot, and ask of you to bring back pieces of Sharlayan flagstone so I may put the conspiracies to rest.","id":1207,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Second Commander Ser Handeloup","lvl":58,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[31.43,21.03],"zoneid":2001,"areaid":2033,"gil":3516,"rewards":487,"plate":80040,"frame":80002,"areaicon":110097},"rewards":{"id":487,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":44}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
