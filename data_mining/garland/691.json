{"leve":{"name":"Shaken, Not Stirred","description":"With trade routes open again, my establishment is oft frequented by merchants and caravans hailing from the deserts of Thanalan, where they prefer their drinks flavored with all manner of sweet fruit and herbs. Why anyone would spoil a fine cup of mead with a foul weed plucked from the underbrush is beyond me, but if it means a few extra coins in my coffer, I'm willing to oblige. And, as such, I'm always looking to purchase high-quality galago mint from anyone willing to sell.","id":691,"patch":2.0,"client":"Buscarron's Druthers Proprietor, Buscarron Strongarm","lvl":20,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000823,"coords":[22.72,21.96],"zoneid":56,"areaid":129,"rewards":217,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110016},"rewards":{"id":217,"entries":[{"item":21072,"rate":0.4},{"item":6141,"rate":0.2},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":40}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000823","obj":{"i":1000823,"n":"Nyell","l":56,"q":1,"t":"Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"6141","obj":{"i":6141,"n":"Cordial","l":25,"c":20622,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
