{"leve":{"name":"Berries Got Bucked","description":"Last night, a pair of peistes ambushed a three-chocobo caravan, killing one bird and sending the other two fleeing. The two surviving chocobos arrived back safely at our stables this morning, but their cargo of Black Shroud berries was missing. It is thought that the crates may have been thrown from the birds' backs during the struggle, and might still be lying somewhere near the site of the ambush. The Seventy-Seven Caravans are seeking adventurers to travel into western Thanalan and attempt to locate and retrieve the missing cargo.
