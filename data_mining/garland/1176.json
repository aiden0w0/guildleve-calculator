{"leve":{"name":"Mending Wings (L)","description":"A chocobo breeder has made an urgent request from the battlefield for bushels of Thaliak's thumb, a herb used to treat gaping wounds that are like to bleed profusely. While I know not of the reasons why he is unable to secure his own stock, I dare not refuse the request, for it is known that one military chocobo is worth three men on the field of battle. Travel to the Dravanian hinterlands and gather Thaliak's thumb roots in haste, and worry not of the expense, I shall ensure you are paid well.","id":1176,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Hospitalier Captain Abel Whitecape","lvl":58,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[26.62,23.34],"zoneid":2001,"areaid":2033,"gil":6116,"rewards":477,"plate":80030,"frame":80002,"areaicon":110092},"rewards":{"id":477,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":30},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":44},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":44}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
