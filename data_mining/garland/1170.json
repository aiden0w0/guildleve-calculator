{"leve":{"name":"These Colors Run Not (L)","description":"The Temple Knight standard, with its brilliant azure hue, flies high to serve as a beacon in the heavens to remind Ishgardians that they must ever be vigilant. Banners made pale by the elements must be quickly replaced with ones freshly dyed so that the colors may never fade from view, else our fervor wanes in the Fury's eyes. There is naught but one flower which produces a dye rich and vibrant enough to sufficeâ”€the bright bluecloud. Venture to the Sea of Clouds and procure as many as you can so that our banners may be dipped in a valor that withstands the test of time.","id":1170,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Second Commander Ser Handeloup","lvl":56,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[12.48,31.43],"zoneid":2100,"areaid":2116,"gil":7003,"rewards":476,"plate":80044,"frame":80002,"areaicon":110094},"rewards":{"id":476,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1,"amount":3},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":26},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":26},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":26},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":26},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":26},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":26},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":38},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":38},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":38},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":38},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":38},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":38}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
