{"leve":{"name":"If a Tree Falls","description":"Scattered throughout the Twelveswood, there stand trees so tall that they are thought to be the pillars which support the heavens, so ancient that they were giants when the first Elezen arrived in Eorzea thousands of summers past. It is even written that the snead of the scythe wielded by the goddess Nophica Herself was carved from one of these hoary sentinels. They are the silent protectors of the forest, the spirits residing deep within their hearts helping to maintain balance within the region. If even one were to fall, it could spell devastation. This is why the  Botanists' Guild takes regular samples from the roots of these trees to determine if they have been afflicted by any manner of sickness or blight.","id":679,"patch":2.0,"client":"Botanists' Guild Receptionist, Leonceault Leadthumb","lvl":5,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1001866,"coords":[28.64,19.53],"zoneid":54,"areaid":90,"rewards":214,"plate":80029,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110013},"rewards":{"id":214,"entries":[{"item":4,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":3,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":2,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":5,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":7,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":6,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":4,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":3,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":2,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":5,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":7,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":6,"rate":0.04,"amount":28}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1001866","obj":{"i":1001866,"n":"Muriaule","l":54,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
