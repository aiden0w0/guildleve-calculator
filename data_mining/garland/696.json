{"leve":{"name":"Appleanche","description":"The skies have been kind to the Twelveswood's orchards, the result being apple yields almost twice the size they were but a year ago. There is so much fruit on the trees, in fact, that the local farmers do not have the capacity to gather it all before it falls from the trees and becomes bruised and riddled with worms. To see that all the apples make it to market, the Greatloam Growery is seeking botanists to assist in this season's harvest.","id":696,"patch":2.0,"client":"Botanists' Guild Receptionist, Leonceault Leadthumb","lvl":25,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000823,"coords":[25.64,18.37],"zoneid":56,"areaid":129,"rewards":218,"plate":80030,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110017},"rewards":{"id":218,"entries":[{"item":21072,"rate":0.4},{"item":6141,"rate":0.2},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":13},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":44},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":44}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000823","obj":{"i":1000823,"n":"Nyell","l":56,"q":1,"t":"Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"6141","obj":{"i":6141,"n":"Cordial","l":25,"c":20622,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
