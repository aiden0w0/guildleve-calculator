{"leve":{"name":"Six Hours in a Leaky Boat","description":"My recent travel by airship to Camp Cloudtop through a passing storm was a miserable experience. A Temple Knight of low rank knows not to complain, yet even I found myself shivering in drenched armor from the rainwater dripping from the planks.
