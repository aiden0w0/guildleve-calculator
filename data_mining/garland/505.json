{"leve":{"name":"Nutbreaker Suite","description":"Quickness in the field is a trait highly valued amongst lancers, and therefore Wood Wailer recruits are forced to endure a number of rigorous training exercises in order to improve agility─one of those being what veteran instructors call “the chase.” While seemingly simple─catching a squirrel released into the wild and bringing it back to the Bannock─the tiny creatures are remarkably nimble, and it has been known to take some recruits several turns of the sun to complete the task. The Wood Wailers are in constant need of new squirrels to use in the exercise, and will pay for any pacified and delivered alive.","id":505,"patch":2.0,"client":"1st Bow of the Quiver's Centaurs, Galfrid Mossback","lvl":1,"jobCategory":34,"levemete":1001866,"coords":[27.76,15.37],"zoneid":54,"areaid":90,"plate":80038,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110008},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1001866","obj":{"i":1001866,"n":"Muriaule","l":54,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
