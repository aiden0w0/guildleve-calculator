{"leve":{"name":"I'll Show You My Battle Shards","description":"The Skysteel Manufactory has developed a new cannon, one which may outperform even our beloved Big Bertha. This prototype can gravely gore the foe with aspected shrapnel, shredding scale, flesh, and bone while stopping the heart with a charge from a lightning core. However, the production of the ammunition requires precious chunks of lancite, which is hard to come by and can only be extracted by the most seasoned of miners.","id":1185,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Second Commander Ser Handeloup","lvl":52,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[34.85,26.17],"zoneid":2000,"areaid":2018,"gil":1062,"rewards":479,"plate":80030,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110096},"rewards":{"id":479,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":16}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
