{"leve":{"name":"On the Lamb","description":"Ever since our old sheep hound was mangled by a pair of megalocrabs, his replacement has caused us nothing but trouble. Not only does the flea-ridden mutt run slower than a one-legged stag, but he spends most of the day looking for some tree to mark, when he isn't eating the chickens' feed. Thanks to him, we lose nigh on half a dozen of our flock every day, which is why, until our faithful old hound's legs heal, we require adventurers to find the stray sheep and lead them back to the Stead. They may be a tad overstrung, so a little coercing with your blade may be required before soothing them.","id":511,"patch":2.0,"client":"Red Rooster Stead Shepherd, Moegramm Sheepsong","lvl":1,"jobCategory":34,"levemete":1004342,"coords":[24.82,23.86],"zoneid":31,"areaid":200,"plate":80038,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110028},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1004342","obj":{"i":1004342,"n":"Wyrkholsk","l":31,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
