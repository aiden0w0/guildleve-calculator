{"leve":{"name":"Nectar of the Goddess (L)","description":"I fondly recall when the church would hold an anointing service, where sweet-scented nectar was rubbed lightly onto the forearms as a way of making one presentable in their prayers. Alas, I wonder if those days are history, as the flower which provided the nectar has been driven nearly to extinction since Coerthas has withered under winter's icy grasp. If only a suitable alternative could be found! I wish to employ a skilled botanist to travel to the Sea of Clouds to collect flower samples for me so I might try and revive the service.
