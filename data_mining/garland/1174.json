The Congregation seeks the services of one with knowledge of deadly flora to scour the hinterlands and find samples which will cause our foes pain everlasting.","id":1174,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Second Commander Ser Handeloup","lvl":58,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[28.46,19.79],"zoneid":2001,"areaid":2033,"gil":981,"rewards":472,"plate":80040,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110092},"rewards":{"id":472,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":15},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":22},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":22}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
