{"leve":{"name":"The Merits of Upcycling","description":"I am certain you have noticed the dark stone beacons placed on the sides of the road. They were used when Falcon's Nest was populated by more children than broadswords to light the roads and guide villagers home after toiling the fields. They have, however, been in disuse since the Calamity, and rather than have them merely sit there slowly eroding away, I would see the stone retrieved and repurposed for rebuilding the hamlet. I leave you with the task of dismantling pieces of the beacons to see if we can salvage some of the materials for our current reconstruction.","id":1180,"patch":3.0,"client":"Temple Knights Second Commander Ser Handeloup","lvl":50,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[30.97,32.98],"zoneid":2200,"areaid":2204,"gil":639,"rewards":478,"plate":80040,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110095},"rewards":{"id":478,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":15}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
