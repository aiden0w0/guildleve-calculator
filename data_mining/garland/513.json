{"leve":{"name":"Road Rage","description":"Not a day goes by when one of our caravans is not assaulted by some creature lurking behind some tree or boulder. Our birds are trained to flee from any danger, and the mercenary escorts we have in our employ do a fine job of fending off attacks. Still, sacks torn and crates broken in these assaults account for a great deal of lost profits, and the Seventy-Seven Caravans cannot afford to lose any more cargo than we already have. Therefore, we seek adventurers to patrol our trade routes and clear the roadsides of any beasts that may be looking to ambush our birds.","id":513,"patch":2.0,"client":"Seventy-Seven Caravans Dispatch, Guntram Greenbank","lvl":1,"jobCategory":34,"levemete":1003888,"coords":[27.92,25.26],"zoneid":42,"areaid":263,"plate":80021,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110022},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1003888","obj":{"i":1003888,"n":"Graceful Song","l":42,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
