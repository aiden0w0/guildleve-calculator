{"leve":{"name":"Just the Artifacts, Madam","description":"In the countless generations since the fall of Gelmorra, the Twelveswood has reclaimed much of the ancient city, so to uncover the civilization's lost secrets, a little digging is ofttimes necessary. The land around Issom-Har is known to yield a variety of Gelmorran artifacts such as coins and potsherds which have become tangled in the roots of giant trees. While of no value to most, these relics of a past age are the subject of my ongoing studies into Gridania's history, and I will pay a fair price for any items you may find.","id":692,"patch":2.0,"client":"Seeker of Antiquity, Rolandaix of House Nevelle","lvl":20,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000823,"coords":[17.07,22.21],"zoneid":56,"areaid":129,"rewards":217,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110016},"rewards":{"id":217,"entries":[{"item":21072,"rate":0.4},{"item":6141,"rate":0.2},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":12},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":40},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":40}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000823","obj":{"i":1000823,"n":"Nyell","l":56,"q":1,"t":"Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"6141","obj":{"i":6141,"n":"Cordial","l":25,"c":20622,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
