{"leve":{"name":"The Palm in Your Hand","description":"It appears that the sago palms that Lalafellin tycoon Gegeruju planted five summers ago in Bloodshore to remind him of his summer home in the Cieldalaes are not only pleasant to look upon, but can also be quite delicious...or at least according to one of my new chefs who is also from the islands. According to her, the pith which is found within the tree's thick trunk can be boiled down into a starchy paste which is high in energy. I wish to try this peculiar food myself, and require several fresh samples.","id":698,"patch":2.0,"client":"Bismarck Guildmaster, Lyngsath Hyllbornsyn","lvl":30,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1004344,"coords":[30.89,27.27],"zoneid":32,"areaid":206,"rewards":219,"plate":80029,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110039},"rewards":{"id":219,"entries":[{"item":21072,"rate":0.4},{"item":6141,"rate":0.2},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":15},{"item":4,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":3,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":2,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":5,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":7,"rate":0.03,"amount":48},{"item":6,"rate":0.03,"amount":48}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1004344","obj":{"i":1004344,"n":"Nahctahr","l":32,"q":1,"t":"Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"6141","obj":{"i":6141,"n":"Cordial","l":25,"c":20622,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
