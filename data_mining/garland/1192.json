{"leve":{"name":"Talk about Boundaries","description":"The expeditions returning from the Churning Mists have piqued the curiosity of the Friars Templar, and our order has been wondering if there may be any historical items laying about that would aid in our teachings. The very air of those lands is thick with the sacrilege of the fiends that infest them, and so I could not possibly make the trek myself. I would employ you to travel there in my stead and bring back any ancient relics you may find.","id":1192,"patch":3.0,"client":"Order of the Friars Templar, Brother Padilloux","lvl":54,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[28.2,31.73],"zoneid":2002,"areaid":2042,"gil":902,"rewards":480,"plate":80040,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110098},"rewards":{"id":480,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":12},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":18},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":18}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
