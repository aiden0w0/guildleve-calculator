{"leve":{"name":"Evil Seeds","description":"In one season, a single ochu can produce over a hundred seeds, which, as the creature makes its way through the forest, are oft caught on the moss growing on tree trunks. If left to germinate, the seeds give rise to microchusâ”€a vile plant which has the tendency to sap the soil of its nutrients, leaving little to none for the other foliage. To keep the microchu population in check, the Greatloam Growery seeks botanists to search mossy trees for these seeds and bring them back to the guild for proper disposal.","id":680,"patch":2.0,"client":"Botanists' Guild, Master Gabineaux","lvl":5,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1001866,"coords":[26.35,22.34],"zoneid":54,"areaid":90,"rewards":214,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110013},"rewards":{"id":214,"entries":[{"item":4,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":3,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":2,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":5,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":7,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":6,"rate":0.13,"amount":8},{"item":4,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":3,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":2,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":5,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":7,"rate":0.04,"amount":28},{"item":6,"rate":0.04,"amount":28}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1001866","obj":{"i":1001866,"n":"Muriaule","l":54,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
