{"leve":{"name":"A Chest of Nuts","description":"Once found throughout the Twelveswood, wild Gridanian chestnuts have become an increasing rarity due to the loss of a majority of the region's chestnut trees to Calamity-induced wildfires. The trees that were replanted after the fires have only begun to mature and bear fruit, and still require a great deal of tending before they will be ready for harvesting. To determine the amount and type of care required, close examination of the chestnuts is necessary, and therefore the Greatloam Growery is actively seeking botanists to visit the chestnut grove near Galvanth's Spire and retrieve an amount upon which a suitable hypothesis can be built.","id":682,"patch":2.0,"client":"Botanists' Guild Receptionist, Leonceault Leadthumb","lvl":10,"jobCategory":18,"levemete":1000105,"coords":[23.19,26.74],"zoneid":54,"areaid":94,"rewards":215,"plate":80029,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110014},"rewards":{"id":215,"entries":[{"item":4,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":3,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":2,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":5,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":7,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":6,"rate":0.13,"amount":10},{"item":4,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":3,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":2,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":5,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":7,"rate":0.04,"amount":32},{"item":6,"rate":0.04,"amount":32}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000105","obj":{"i":1000105,"n":"Tierney","l":54,"q":2,"t":"Levemete"}}]}
