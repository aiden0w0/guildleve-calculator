{"leve":{"name":"Halone's Jewelry Box","description":"Star sapphires are considered pious jewels, used in prayer and said to grant visions of Halone's halls to the faithful. Dusty tomes oft say when the morning light hits the stone just right, it reflects a radiance that would allow a man to see paradise. Regardless of whether or not this is true, the symbolism alone has holy men of the clergy adorning themselves in jewelry with set stones, and I would pay a good price to any miner who can bring me choice sapphires.","id":1186,"patch":3.0,"client":"Order of the Friars Templar, Brother Padilloux","lvl":52,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[37.78,22.65],"zoneid":2000,"areaid":2018,"gil":997,"rewards":479,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110096},"rewards":{"id":479,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":11},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":16},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":16}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
