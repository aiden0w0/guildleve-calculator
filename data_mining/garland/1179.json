{"leve":{"name":"The Road to Pilgrimage","description":"Some hundred summers past, the Holy See decreed twelve towers be built, monuments to each of the first Heavens' Ward. So inspired were the Ishgardian people by the spires' majesty, many embarked on pilgrimages to each tower during the warmer moons. Wind, hellfire, and the pillaging hands of the zealous lowborn have since seen those spiritual citadels reduced to ruin, and now only the Ninth Vare continues its silent vigil. But now with the change of climate due to the Calamity, it too is suffering from the eroding effects of ice. Bring slabs of rock so that those blocks that have crumbled may be replaced.","id":1179,"patch":3.0,"client":"Order of the Friars Templar, Brother Padilloux","lvl":50,"jobCategory":17,"levemete":1011208,"coords":[29.89,34.24],"zoneid":2200,"areaid":2204,"gil":834,"rewards":478,"plate":80044,"frame":80005,"areaicon":110095},"rewards":{"id":478,"entries":[{"item":12669,"rate":0.1},{"item":21072,"rate":0.1},{"item":10,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":9,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":8,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":11,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":13,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":12,"rate":0.08,"amount":10},{"item":10,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":9,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":8,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":11,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":13,"rate":0.05,"amount":15},{"item":12,"rate":0.05,"amount":15}]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011208","obj":{"i":1011208,"n":"Eloin","l":2300,"q":1,"t":"Temple Levemete"}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"21072","obj":{"i":21072,"n":"Venture","l":1,"c":65049,"t":100}}]}
